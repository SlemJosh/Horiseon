## Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This project was all about refactoring a website's work.  Was tasked with going through the already provided HTML and making appropriate changes.
Worked on sectioning out the file so that it would be easier to work on it piece by piece.  Looked for errors in the code provided as well, which 
included fixing links to the css file.  Found some formatting issues in the code, and went through to make sure they would work.  Also as a primary
focus was to make the page accessible added some alt tags for images just in case they would not load on someones personal device. 

Went through many efforts of debugging as I would implement new code, and see where I could actually combine code to make the actions more precise. There 
seemed to be a lot of opportunity for consolidation on the css sheet. I believe there could be even more with some additional work. This project showcased 
how important it is to document changes and to be able to isolate specific issues so as to not get caught up working on too many issues at one time. 
Because of all the reformatting I did on the css, I thought it best to keep a backup file of the original as well.  Used the terminal to create a new 
style.css file and just renamed the old one for backup purposes. This could have been done by also just creating a new branch as well.

Along with using the knowledge I gained from the course already, this project also had me doing my own research to see some of the best practices as well
as why certain steps in the code were taken.  For example there is a background image that was put on the stylesheet instead of the html page.  This allowed for
more customization of that image, but at the same time took away the opportunity to add a descriptor should that file not load. In my research I found that best practice
is to have those images right on the HTML so that they can include those accessability options, however if they are just a background image, then they aren't nearly as important.
Utilizing all the tools not only had me fix things now, but I am constantly finding other ways to continue to fix this specific project.
